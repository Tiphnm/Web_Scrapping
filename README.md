# Web_Scrapping

Goal: Learn how to webscrap. 

## Project 

Free to choose the website of our choise, I choose Maison du Monde. Through a Python script I scrapped the needed data: carpet(price and name), mirrors (price and name). 
Thanks to SQL I've created to tables: Carpet and Mirrors. 
Finally with Flask I create roots to show my data to my potential users. 
The final step was to put all the logic in docker's container.
