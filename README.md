# Web_Scrapping

Goal: Learn how to webscrap after two months of learning how to code from scratch.

## Project 
Chossing the website of our choice, we scrapped the data to fill our database (MYSQL). Then we used Flask to create roots for our potential users. The final step was to put all the logic in docker's container. 

### Languages and tools
